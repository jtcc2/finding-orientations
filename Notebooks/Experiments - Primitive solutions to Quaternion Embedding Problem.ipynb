    "- Larger $D$ is better. Finding primitive solutions is faster, and there is a greater chance primitive solutions exist.\n",
    "- The more factors the conductor has, the less likely the 1st solution we find will be primitive, but the probability a primitive solution is found within the first 5 iterations only decreases a little.\n",
    "- Generally, the larger the conductor of the quadratic order the better - as long as there aren't lots more factors, and excluding the $C=1$ case where all solutions are primitive.\n",
    "- For large $p$ it is worse for embedding a small norm $d$ ($d = C^2 D$ or $d = C^2 (N+1)/4$), but when you get up to large enough $d$ it's almost the same as for small p. For instance $C = 2$, with $D > p^2$ the results are very close to small $p$ results. This is expected as there are very few elements in an order of small norm, except for squares, so for small $D$ we are likely sampling more squares."
